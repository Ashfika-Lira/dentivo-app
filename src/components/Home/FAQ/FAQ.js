          <Accordion.Header>How to make payment</Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
          Making it as easy as possible for your customers to pay is essential for increasing conversions and sales.This is why your checkout page is critical. It’s the final stop for people shopping on your website. It’s the place where they hand over their credit card information and finally part with their hard-earned cash.Together, these three elements of your online payment system process the entire transaction from beginning to end, withdrawing the funds from your customer’s bank account and depositing them in your business’s merchant account.There are two main ways to take payments from customers online: credit/debit cards and Direct Debit.

          <Accordion.Body>
          Divide the hourly cost for delivery operations by the number of deliveries made each hour. If three deliveries are made and the cost of hourly operations is $60, then the average cost for delivery is $20.A free shipping strategy is a great way to stand out from your competition, grab the attention of your website visitors and turn them into loyal customers.Another shipping option for your online store is to charge the exact amount that you normally would be charged to deliver your products in real-time.Offering flat rate shipping is an easy way to cover most of your shipping costs. You can either offer a standard delivery fee per order or flat rates for weight ranges.Usually the rate is $20 to $500.
